# Thermoelectrically Entangled MOFs (tee_mof)
Investigating effect of interpenetration on the thermal conductivity of metal-organic frameworks

![alt text][Fig1]

- a) Idealized porous crystal (8 × 8 × 8 cubic unit cells), single unit cell highlighted in red
- b) Bonding arrangement for single unit cell using Morse potential (red bonds are modeled stronger than blue bonds)
- c) Doubly interpenetrated unit cells with framework depicted as red and blue (initial frameworks in each simulation are 5 Å apart in each dimension
- d) Interpenetrated idealized porous crystal (8 × 8 × 8 cubic unit cells).
